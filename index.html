            <p>I have been interested in web design since high school. I worked on the school's first ever website and absolutely
            loved every minute. I am currently studying Computer Science at Salt Lake Community College. I will be graduating with an
            Associate's Degree in May of 2020. Even when I am not in school I am looking at different programs to keep learning.
            I am trying to learn as many programming languages I can so that my programming abilities are not focused on a certain
            language.</p>
            <p>I have been studying HTML, CSS, SQL, Javascript, React, Java, and PHP. I would also like to start learning Python, C++
             and C#.</P>
