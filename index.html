          <h3 class="post-title">Becoming a web developer</h3>
          <div class="post-content">
            <p>I must say becoming a web developer is no easy task. Especially when you are the only person in the family studying
            Computer Science. So where to start is a confusing difficult task. I have two more semesters left to get my Associates Degree
            then I am praying to get a job in my field of interest. Hopefully my future job will allow me to attend school to get a Bachelors
            Degree. That is one of my ultimate goals. But we will tackle that challenge when it get closer.</p>
            
            <p>In my search for a job in web design I have noticed they want a portfolio to look at. So being that I have no idea what to put in 
            my portfolio I have started to research it. I have no idea if that is helping or confusing me more. What do I put in my resume? What do
            I not put in my resume? What do I put in my portfolio? What do I not include in my portfolio? Knowing where to start I guess would be the
            hardest. But I have always thought that using your resources can never hurt. So I ask advise my one of my college professors. Can't 
            hurt right? </p>

          <div class="post-content">
            <p>I have been interested in web design since high school. I worked on the school's first ever website and absolutely
            loved every minute. I am currently studying Computer Science at Salt Lake Community College. I will be graduating with an
            Associate's Degree in May of 2020. Even when I am not in school I am looking at different programs to keep learning.
            I am trying to learn as many programming languages I can so that my programming abilities are not focused on a certain
            language.</p>
            <p>I have been studying HTML, CSS, SQL, Javascript, React, Java, and PHP. I would also like to start learning Python, C++
             and C#.</P>
